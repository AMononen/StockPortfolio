StockPortfolio
==============

A simple implementation of a stocks' portfolio to demonstrate the use of mocking principles for unit-testing.  
I have used [EasyMock](http://easymock.org) as a framework of reference.  
To import the framework in you Eclipse Java project please refere to [this](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3280353/how-to-import-a-jar-in-eclipse) article on Stack Overflow
